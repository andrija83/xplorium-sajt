## How to Use Sub-Agents

### Method 1: Explicit Invocation
Simply mention the agent name in your request:

```
"Use frontend-developer to optimize the starburst explosion animation"
"Use code-reviewer to review the liquid morph effect"
"Use performance-engineer to analyze the bundle size"
```

### Method 2: Automatic Delegation
Claude Code will automatically suggest appropriate agents based on your request context.

### Method 3: Multi-Agent Coordination
For complex tasks, invoke the agent-organizer:

```
"Use agent-organizer to plan a performance optimization strategy for the entire site"
```

## Example Usage for Xplorium

### Animation Improvements
```
"Use frontend-developer to create a new particle effect for the cafe section background"
"Use react-pro to optimize the liquid morph animation performance"
```

### Code Quality
```
"Use code-reviewer to review the starburst explosion code"
"Use architect-review to evaluate the single-file component architecture"
```

### Performance
```
"Use performance-engineer to analyze Framer Motion animation performance"
"Use deployment-engineer to optimize the Vercel deployment configuration"
```

### Testing
```
"Use test-automator to create Playwright tests for the navigation flow"
"Use qa-expert to design a testing strategy for the animation effects"
```

## Agent Files Location
All agent definitions: `~/.claude/claude-code-sub-agents/agents/`

## Next Steps

1. **Try an agent**: Ask me to "Use code-reviewer to review the recent liquid morph animation"
2. **Explore agents**: Check individual agent files to see their specific capabilities
3. **Customize**: Modify agent files to better fit your workflow (optional)

## Benefits

- 🎯 **Specialized Expertise**: Each agent is optimized for specific tasks
- 🚀 **Higher Quality**: Agents follow best practices for their domain
- 📚 **Better Context**: Agents have domain-specific knowledge
- 🔄 **Coordination**: Multi-agent workflows for complex tasks

## Trade-offs

- ⏱️ **Processing Time**: Multi-agent workflows take 2-5x longer
- 💰 **Token Usage**: More tokens consumed for agent coordination
- ✨ **Better Results**: Higher quality output justifies the extra resources
